LabScripts
==========
These scripts are intended for use by our lab with the UCHC CCAM SGE cluster sigcluster2.

To use the scripts the user must source or softlink from the .bash_profile file contained within (which will automatically set up the environment to support the tools in their standard locations)

any deviation from the included tools will have to be done at your own risk and requires changing all file paths defined in these scripts to your staged copy location
