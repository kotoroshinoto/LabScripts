This directory is where the old perl pipeline that was used on the TORQUE cluster 
will reside until we decide it is safe to delete it.

It will be disappearing from the repository once the old pipeline is reconfigured.

the files currently in cgi-bin will be moved to cgi-bin-old when they are replaced 
(so we still have them)
